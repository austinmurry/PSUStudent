        <p class="about">This is an image of an E-Sports logo that I had begun developing back in my Graphic Design 100 course. The logo is a depiction of the more famously known character, Link from the Legend of Zelda game series. My team name was TheTacticalElves, so he fit the image perfectly. My idea was to create an image of Link, but instead of his signature green tunic and blonde hair, I would do brown hair and a blue tunic to resemble me and my favorite color. He then is shown having a visor and ear piece across his face to resemble the "tactical part". This came from the other popularly known character Soldier 76 from the Overwatch game. He wears a visor that covers his entire face and his ultimate move is called "Tactical Visor" so I found this fitting. This was the first draft though of the image and I would love to come back to it one day and revise it and improve upon it.</p>
