        <h1 class="essay">GitHub Pages and Wordpress Comparative Essay</h1>
        <p class="essay">As I have learned throughout my time working with both GitHub Pages and
            Wordpress, I have found that making a website sometimes isn't really easy. Although
            sometimes it's not easy, it can be a lot of fun to see your hard work all pay off when
            you get to visually see the final product come to life on the page. I have had a really
            fun time working with both of these programs and have come to love and hate both of
            their work flows a lot over the past couple of weeks, but when it comes to having to
            pick a favorite I do have a clear winner and that has to be GitHub Pages. While both
            have their similarities and differences, I like the workflow and user experience of
            GitHub Pages much much more than Wordpress, so let's dive into why.</p>
        <p class="essay">When it comes to the challenges for new learners, GitHub pages has the
            harder workflow for sure. GitHub Pages uses a combination of HTML files and a CSS file
            to create your website. Using this file types can definitely be a daunting to any new
            learner, but once you get to use it and play around with it, it becomes much easier to
            use. Though the thing that makes it a challenge for new learners is that it doesn't
            outright tell you how to use it or what to do exactly. You will have to go to websites
            such as W3 Schools and google to find out how to do certain things and teach yourself
            really. Wordpress takes the cake as the easier way to make a website though. The
            directions are all kinda just laid out there for you so you don't have to go around and
            search, you can change the appearance of your website with the click of a button, and
            adding new content to a page is really easy as they give you text boxes that you can
            just type everything out in instead of using html elements and attributes. So when it
            comes to the challenges for new learners GitHub Pages is much harder to learn and
            Wordpress is fairly simple.</p>
        <p class="essay">Although Wordpress is easier to use, I feel that that ease of use doesn't
            really teach you the basics of making a website and it doesn't exactly give you the same
            completion feeling that using HTML and CSS does. While HTML may be harder to learn, I
            think the long term advantages that come from learning HTML are much better than the
            simple style of learning in Wordpress. HTML also gives you much more when it comes to
            exactly how you want to style your webpages since you can literally change every aspect
            of the page you want to fit your style and your needs. This flows into the challenges
            for modifying the layout of the sites as well since as I stated before, Wordpress gives
            you many pre-made themes for you to choose from, but you are only limited to those
            themes and layouts. Yes there are aspects of the layouts you can change like the colors
            and the images used, but that's really all there is to change. With HTML you can set up
            the layout and organization of the page literally however you would like. You can change
            the size of images at will, reposition those images, and your paragraphs, make boxes
            that lay across the entire screen and change how they stagger or how they are oriented,
            create custom menus and sub-menus and change their layouts, the possibilities seem
            endless!</p>
        <p class="essay">As for skills necessary to develop in HTML you will need to have a basic
            understanding of coding and how the structure of code works. There are plenty of
            tutorials and videos out there that will help, so you will need to go and look things up
            for sure when it comes to developing in HTML. You will also have to know the basic
            structure of GitHub and how to add, commit and push changes to your site, but again you
            can find tutorials online for that as well. Wordpress, all you need to do is have basic
            computer and organization skills and know how to type because it is that easy to use. As
            for skills I want to learn to improve, I want to learn how to make a more detailed and
            improved website with interactive images and 3D models. I feel as though I have a good
            understanding of HTML web development after these past few months and I think learning
            how to do these things will take my web development skills to the next level.</p>
        <p class="essay">So all in all, I am very happy with how both of my websites turned out and
            I had a great experience working with both programs. I am definitely going to continue
            to develop my site and make it the best version of itself it can possibly be, but I am
            most certainly going to continue this is GitHub Pages and HTML. It is not because I will
            lose my Wordpress after I graduate, but simply because now that I have learned how to
            use HTML and GitHub Pages more efficiently, I am in love with the workflow of it. I also
            think that using GitHub Pages is so much more rewarding when you get to see all the hard
            work that you struggled with for hours pay off in a visual form of your website. That is
            what drives me to want to continue to build my site and my skills for the future to
            come.</p>
