        <p class="essay2">The game I chose to analyze for my final project in DIGIT 100 was Arietta of Spirits. This is a game developed by Third Spirit Games. This game, upon <br/>first glance, seems like it is just another one of those "hack and slash" adventure games, but once you get towards the end of it and start to really look at it, <br/>you realize there is so much more to the story. It dives into some hard subjects to cover, especially for the type of game it appears to be, but it also hits you <br/>right at your heart when you realize the connections that you have made with certain characters and then the sacrifices they must make.</p>

        <p class="essay2">The game starts with an immediate bang and foreshadows what the feel for the rest of the game is going to be. It starts off with Arietta and her family driving to their <br/>Grandmothers cabin in the woods, the year after she has passed away. Everyone is heartbroken and is having a hard time coping with this concept of her passing as a <br/>whole, but they try to make the best of it. This is just the beginning though of this games theme of loss and sacrifice. After the first night in the cabin, Arietta has <br/>a strange dream and has makes an interesting discover that will change her life.</p>

        <p class="essay2">This dream takes her on her first trip into the Spirit Realm, which will be the concept for the rest of the game. She travels along a path and is enveloped by strange <br/>spirits before she is saved by a blue light. She wakes up in her bed and hears a voice, this voice comes from this blue figure in the corner of the room. This characters<br/> name is Arco and he reveals the big plot of the story to Arietta. He explains that she is what's called a "Bound" and that he is a "Spirit Guide". Spirit guides attach <br/>themselves to bounds and the bounds help to defend the world from the evil spirits, a.k.a roamers, and create the link between the Spirit Realm and the Human Realm. <br/>The rest of the game then Follows Arietta and her quest to save the world from the roamers, which almost leads to her demise.</p>

        <p class="essay2">The settings are very complex and there is a lot to explore in this game. The forest encompasses the whole map, so no matter which direction you go you are going to dive deeper <br/>into the forest. It spreads north of the central cabin location, east of the cabin, and west of the cabin and it just seems to go on. The other big part of the setting is the silver mine. <br/>The silver mine goes pretty deep and it makes you explore the entirety of it in order to unlock the elevator that takes you to the lower levels for the boss fight. What makes the <br/>settings distinctive is that none of them are the same. If you go south of the cabin you will find a Apple tree that you pick apples from for your mom. The enemies here are also very <br/>simple since it is one of the first areas you go. To the east is still more forest, but the developers added in flowing rivers and waterfalls since this side of the map holds what is <br/>known as the Forestside Spring. If you go north of the cabin this is where you will find both the outhouse for the cabin as well as the location for the silver mine. Only catch is that <br/>you can't access the silver mine yet so you must go to a burnt down cabin further north. The game then shows how the spirit realm and human realm can connect by pulling the built <br/>cabin from the spirit realm to the location of the burnt down one. You find a women in the cabin who doesn't know she is dead and you do a collection task for her so that you can <br/>clear the path to the silver mine. As you travel to the silver mine the bridge breaks below you and you must travel through the underground cavern to make your way back up to the <br/>mine. So overall this game has a vast amount that the player can explore and the settings are very complex in some situations.</p>

        <p class="essay2">You mainly interact with the sword you carry around and your ring to summon Arco. You can also interact with the environment of the game, using the pesticide to <br/>destroy trees and brush that is blocking your path, and activating levers to open closed doors. Inside of the Silver Mine there are also a set of journal pages that you <br/>are tasked to find, and these journal pages tell you the truth of what happened in the mines and what the miners did to Minerva and her burnt down cabin in the <br/>woods. You do not need to consume food in this game, but you do have a health bar and if you run low on health you can destroy small shrubs with your sword and <br/>they have a chance to drop hearts for you to pick up and refill your lost health.</p>

        <p class="essay2">You are challenged through the use of combat. You are constantly fighting enemies while you make your way to the final boss battles. You are asked to investigate <br/>the different settings in order to defeat all of the roamers that have come to the human realm from the spirit realm. The boss battles can sometimes be very <br/>hard and you can change the difficulty level of the game to make it even harder if you would like, but defeating the bosses at the end of the location is the way <br/>of making progress throughout this game.</p>

        <p class="essay2">The game doesn't directly comment on our reality, but it does touch on different aspects of our culture and our lives as humans. The biggest thing it touches on is the issue of loss. You see <br/>Arietta deal with it two times throughout this game, first with the loss of her grandmother and again with the loss of Arco. After the loss of her grandmother the whole family is <br/>distraught, but they want to make the most of their time they had with their grandmother and go to the cabin and still make it fun. Arietta has the chance to reunite with her grandmother <br/>once more when she meets Arco. Arco describes that her grandmother had asked Arco to find Arietta and help her find her missing ring, aka the ring you get to keep and summon Arco. You <br/>find the ring and your grandmother asks you to give it to your mother before she is finally able to find rest and move on into the afterlife. The other loss that greatly affects her as a <br/>character is that of Arco. When Arco sacrifices himself in order to save Arietta, she almost can't bare the fact of losing him too, he was her friend. Without him she doesn't know how she <br/>will go on and make it out of the sunken realm, but then a set of orbs lead her out to safety, this is once again her grandmothers spirit. Arietta returns to the human world and is found by <br/>police at the burnt down cabin and is taken to her parents where she mourns the loss of her best friend. The game does foreshadow a sequel game and possibly his return as after the <br/>credits a scene rolls where it is three years after the events of this game. Arietta is asleep in her bed with her wooden sword on a plaque above her and her grandmothers ring still on her <br/>finger. She is laying there silently when all of a sudden he ring starts to glow with that blue energy that we associate with Arco and then the scene cuts to black. Other than the issues <br/>of loss and sacrifice, the game doesn't really comment on any other cultural issues, the only other thing I can think of is the miners killing minerva because they believed her to be a <br/>witch, when it was really mercury poisoning from the sliver that was killing them.</p>
